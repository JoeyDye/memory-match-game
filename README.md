# Memory Match Game
The memory match game is a basic play off the classic game known as **Concentration**. In this game, all cards are laid face down, and two cards are flipped face over each turn.

If both cards match, the cards remain face up and game play continues. If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped back over and game play continues.

## Rules

After a certain number of moves a star will be deducted from the overall star rating until the star rating totals 0.

The game can be reset at anytime
