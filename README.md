# Memory Match Game
The memory match game is a play off the classic game known as **Concentration**. The game starts with all cards laid face down. The player then begins flipping over two cards at a time.

If both cards match, the cards remain face up and game play continues. If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped back over and game play continues.

## Rules

After a certain number of moves a star will be deducted from the overall star rating until the star rating totals 0.

The game can be reset at anytime
